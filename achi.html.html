<p> My name is Esther okpare, i am a student of kwara state university from the college of information communication
and technology<br> in the department of library and information science 200 level. I have achieve some things in life, some which goes like this -----------
<p><i> In life we all have achieve one thing or the other, mine started when i was in SS 1, we where done with our 3rd trem exam
waiting for our result the next week.<br> That faithful day the result was out but seeing my biology result i was not happy at all,  from that day i determine to my self that before the end of SS2 first trem i will come out the best student in boilogy 
and it came to pass due to hard work and full concentration in class. i came out the best student in biology in my class and i was rewarded with a gift.</i>
<p><em> Secondly was when it was time for the appointment of new student leaders in my school, the student all voted for their choice of student who will represent them so those who where voted was acked to present a sheech on each post given to.
<br> The day for the presentation i was in my class sitted and going through my books on up coming test, suddenly my maths teacher came to me and side i am to go join the other student for their presentation at the administration block, at first i was very scared because first i was not voted out by the student and secondly i am not prepared at all but with God grace and strength in me i tolk courage and went for the presentation and it all went well so at the end of every thing i was appointed as a house captain of yellow house, so at the end of my SS3 i went home with a big gift as the ex yellow house captain.<br>
Now for this year i have achieve a laptop through hard work and determination during my hollidays, achieving a system was ment to help me during csc 207 praticals and some assignment just like this one been given to me.</em>
